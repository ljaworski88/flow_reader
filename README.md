# Streaming Potential Calculator

This is a pyqt5 application intended to be used with the sensor board included in the src/kicad folder and the Raspberry Pi.

The application is intended to determine the streaming potential of tissues placed within a chamber designed by my collegue by interfacing with two NAU7802 24-bit ADCs connected to seperate pressure transducers, the Sensirion SLG-150 flow meter, and the Keithley 6514 Electrometer.
The included install script should install the application and all required dependancies on a fresh Raspberry Pi install (changing the way sudo operates by default on the pi will break this functionality).
